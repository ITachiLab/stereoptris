# Stereoptris

Stereoptris is a modified version of an open-source project called: [JsTetris](https://github.com/cztomczak/jstetris). The goal of Stereoptris is to help with training a so-called "stereopsis" which is an ability to perceive world in three dimensions. How it's done? It's simple: Stereoptris generates elements in two colors only. When wearing anaglyph glasses, some elements are visible with one eye only, the other elements with the second eye. Eyes and brain have to cooperate in order to generate a single image and allow you to play this game with no effort.

Not every type of anaglyph glasses can be used for this game. I've picked colors which are suitable for glasses that I own (similar glasses are used by doctors when examining stereopsis):

And here you can see how it looks with anaglyph glasses:

## Download & Play

A browser version of the game is available for download. To run it, extract the ZIP file, and open `tetris.html` in your browser. You can download it from the [Releases page](../../releases).

The game window is very small by default, but this can be easily fixed by zooming in the page, it's usually done with `CTRL + Scroll up`.

## Final words

I've decided to create this modification because I lack stereopsis, and I thought this could help me develop this new feature. Similar games were either paid, or not suitable to my glasses. The first time I played it, I knew I had created a torture for myself. The only situation in which I can score more than 3 lines is when elements happen to be generated in a single color, lol.

Play for fun, do not treat it as a treatment. Always seek help of a professional if you have problems with your eyes. Mine are FUBAR already so I can experiment.
